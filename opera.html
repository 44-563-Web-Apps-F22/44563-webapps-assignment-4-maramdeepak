            BOAT. Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy
            captain's
            child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will
            she, lads?
              ALL. No, no.
              DICK. No, no, captains' daughters don't marry foremast hands.
              ALL (recoiling from him). Shame! shame!
              BOAT. Dick Deadeye, them sentiments o' yourn are a disgrace to
            our
            common natur'.
              RALPH, But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man
            who hails
            from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the
            fore-yard
            arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the
            main-truck
            or his slacks on the main-deck.
              DICK. Ah, it's a queer world!
              RALPH. Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you,
            but such
            a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor
            shudder.
              BOAT. My lads, our gallant captain has come on deck; let us
            greet him
            as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves.

                           Of yonder tear that trembles on your eyelash
                           Proclaims a sorrow far more deep than common;

                           My daughter, Josephine, the fairest flower
                           That ever blossomed on ancestral timber,
                           Is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph Porter,
                           Our Admiralty's First Lord, but for some reason
                           She does not seem to tackle kindly to it.
          
              BUT, (with emotion). Ah, poor Sir Joseph! Ah, I know too well
                           The anguish of a heart that loves but vainly!
                           But see, here comes your most attractive daughter.

                      Sad are the sighs that own the spell,
                         Uttered by eyes that speak too plainly;

                      When to the ark the wearied one
                         Flies from the empty waste of waters!

            Enter CAPTAIN
          
              CAPT. My child, I grieve to see that you are a prey to
            melancholy. You
            should look your best to-day, for Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., will
            be here
            this afternoon to claim your promised hand.
              JOS. Ah, father, your words cut me to the quick. I can esteem—
            reverence—venerate Sir Joseph, for he is a great and good man;
            but oh, I
            cannot love him! My heart is already given.
              CAPT. (aside). It is then as I feared. (Aloud.) Given? And to
            whom? Not
            to some gilded lordling?
              JOS. No, father—the object of my love is no lordling. Oh, pity
            me, for
            he is but a humble sailor on board your own ship!
              CAPT. Impossible!
              JOS. Yes, it is true.
              CAPT. A common sailor? Oh fie!
              JOS. I blush for the weakness that allows me to cherish such a
            passion.
            I hate myself when I think of the depth to which I have stooped
            in
            permitting myself to think tenderly of one so ignobly born, but I
            love
            him! I love him! I love him! (Weeps.)
              CAPT. Come, my child, let us talk this over. In a matter of the
            heart I
            would not coerce my daughter—I attach but little value to rank
            or
            wealth, but the line must be drawn somewhere. A man in that
            station may
            be brave and worthy, but at every step he would commit solecisms
            that
            society would never pardon.
              JOS. Oh, I have thought of this night and day. But fear not,
            father, I
            have a heart, and therefore I love; but I am your daughter, and
            therefore
            I am proud. Though I carry my love with me to the tomb, he shall
            never,
            never know it.
              CAPT. You are my daughter after all. But see, Sir Joseph's
            barge
            approaches, manned by twelve trusty oarsmen and accompanied by
            the
            admiring crowd of sisters, cousins, and aunts that attend him
            wherever he
            goes. Retire, my daughter, to your cabin—take this, his
            photograph, with
            you—it may help to bring you to a more reasonable frame of mind.
              JOS. My own thoughtful father!

                      When I was a lad I served a term
                      As office boy to an Attorney's firm.
                      I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,
                      And I polished up the handle of the big front door.
                           I polished up that handle so carefullee
                           That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.—He polished, etc.
          
                      As office boy I made such a mark
                      That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.
                      I served the writs with a smile so bland,
                      And I copied all the letters in a big round hand—
                           I copied all the letters in a hand so free,
                           That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.- He copied, etc.
          
                      In serving writs I made such a name
                      That an articled clerk I soon became;
                      I wore clean collars and a brand-new suit
                      For the pass examination at the Institute,
                           And that pass examination did so well for me,
                           That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.—And that pass examination, etc.
          
                      Of legal knowledge I acquired such a grip
                      That they took me into the partnership.
                      And that junior partnership, I ween,
                      Was the only ship that I ever had seen.
                           But that kind of ship so suited me,
                           That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.- But that kind, etc.
          
                      I grew so rich that I was sent
                      By a pocket borough into Parliament.
                      I always voted at my party's call,
                      And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.
                           I thought so little, they rewarded me
                           By making me the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.- He thought so little, etc.
          
                      Now landsmen all, whoever you may be,
                      If you want to rise to the top of the tree,
                      If your soul isn't fettered to an office stool,
                      Be careful to be guided by this golden rule—
                           Stick close to your desks and never go to sea,
                           And you all may be rulers of the Queen's Navee!
          
            CHORUS.—Stick close, etc.
          
              SIR JOSEPH. You've a remarkably fine crew, Captain Corcoran.
              CAPT. It is a fine crew, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. (examining a very small midshipman). A British
            sailor is a
            splendid fellow, Captain Corcoran.
              CAPT. A splendid fellow indeed, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. I hope you treat your crew kindly, Captain
            Corcoran.
              CAPT. Indeed I hope so, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH, Never forget that they are the bulwarks of
            England's
            greatness, Captain Corcoran.
              CAPT. So I have always considered them, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. No bullying, I trust—no strong language of any
            kind, eh?
              CAPT. Oh, never, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. What, never?
              CAPT. Hardly ever, Sir Joseph. They are an excellent crew, and
            do their
            work thoroughly without it.
              SIR JOSEPH. Don't patronise them, sir—pray, don't patronise
            them.
              CAPT. Certainly not, Sir Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. That you are their captain is an accident of birth.
            I
            cannot permit these noble fellows to be patronised because an
            accident of
            birth has placed you above them and them below you.
              CAPT. I am the last person to insult a British sailor, Sir
            Joseph.
              SIR JOSEPH. You are the last person who did, Captain Corcoran.
            Desire
            that splendid seaman to step forward.
          
                                      (DICK comes forward)
          
              SIR JOSEPH. No, no, the other splendid seaman.
              CAPT. Ralph Rackstraw, three paces to the front—march!
              SIR JOSEPH (sternly). If what?
              CAPT. I beg your pardon—I don't think I understand you.
              SIR JOSEPH. If you please.
              CAPT. Oh, yes, of course. If you please. (RALPH steps forward.)
              SIR JOSEPH. You're a remarkably fine fellow.
              RALPH. Yes, your honour.
              SIR JOSEPH.  And a first-rate seaman, I'll be bound.
              RALPH. There's not a smarter topman in the Navy, your honour,
            though I
            say it who shouldn't.
              SIR JOSEPH. Not at all. Proper self-respect, nothing more. Can
            you
            dance a hornpipe?
              RALPH. No, your honour.
              SIR JOSEPH. That's a pity: all sailors should dance hornpipes.
            I will
            teach you one this evening, after dinner. Now tell me—don't be
            afraid—
            how does your captain treat you, eh?
              RALPH. A better captain don't walk the deck, your honour.
              ALL. Aye; Aye!
              SIR JOSEPH. Good. I like to hear you speak well of your
            commanding
            officer; I daresay he don't deserve it, but still it does you
            credit. Can
            you sing?
              RALPH. I can hum a little, your honour.
              SIR JOSEPH. Then hum this at your leisure. (Giving him MS.
            music.) It
            is a song that I have composed for the use of the Royal Navy. It
            is
            designed to encourage independence of thought and action in the
            lower
            branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a
            British sailor
            is any man's equal, excepting mine. Now, Captain Corcoran, a word
            with
            you in your cabin, on a tender and sentimental subject.
              CAPT. Aye, aye,
              Sir Joseph (Crossing) Boatswain, in commemoration of this
            joyous
            occasion, see that extra grog is served out to the ship's company
            at
            seven bells.
              BOAT. Beg pardon. If what, your honour?
              CAPT. If what? I don't think I understand you.
              BOAT. If you please, your honour.
              CAPT. What!
              SIR JOSEPH. The gentleman is quite right. If you please.
              CAPT. (stamping his foot impatiently). If you please!
            [Exit.
              SIR JOSEPH.  For I hold that on the seas
                           The expression, "if you please",
                                A particularly gentlemanly tone implants.
              COUSIN HEBE. And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
            aunts!
              ALL.       And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
            aunts!
          
                                                     [Exeunt SIR JOSEPH AND
            RELATIVES.
          
              BOAT. Ah! Sir Joseph's true gentleman; courteous and
            considerate to the
            very humblest.
              RALPH. True, Boatswain, but we are not the very humblest. Sir
            Joseph
            has explained our true position to us. As he says, a British
            seaman is
            any man's equal excepting his, and if Sir Joseph says that, is it
            not our
            duty to believe him?
              ALL. Well spoke! well spoke!
              DICK. You're on a wrong tack, and so is he. He means well, but
            he don't
            know. When people have to obey other people's orders, equality's
            out of
            the question.
              ALL (recoiling). Horrible! horrible!
              BOAT. Dick Deadeye, if you go for to infuriate this here ship's
            company
            too far, I won't answer for being able to hold 'em in. I'm
            shocked!
            that's what I am—shocked!
              RALPH. Messmates, my mind's made up. I'll speak to the
            captain's
            daughter, and tell her, like an honest man, of the honest love I
            have for
            her.
              ALL. Aye, aye!
              RALPH. Is not my love as good as another's? Is not my heart as
            true as
            another's? Have I not hands and eyes and ears and limbs like
            another?
              ALL. Aye, Aye!
              RALPH. True, I lack birth—
              BOAT. You've a berth on board this very ship.
              RALPH. Well said—I had forgotten that. Messmates—what do you
            say? Do
            you approve my determination?
              ALL. We do.
              DICK. I don t.
              BOAT. What is to be done with this here hopeless chap? Let us
            sing him
            the song that Sir Joseph has kindly composed for us. Perhaps it
            will
            bring this here miserable creetur to a proper state of mind.
          
                     GLEE!—RALPH, BOATSWAIN, BOATSWAIN'S MATE, and CHORUS
          
                         A British tar is a soaring soul,
                            As free as a mountain bird,
                         His energetic fist should be ready to resist
                            A dictatorial word.
                         His nose should pant and his lip should curl,
                         His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl,
                         His bosom should heave and his heart should glow,
                         And his fist be ever ready for a knock-down blow.
          
            CHORUS.—His nose should pant, etc.
          
                         His eyes should flash with an inborn fire,
                            His brow with scorn be wrung;
                         He never should bow down to a domineering frown,
                            Or the tang of a tyrant tongue.
                         His foot should stamp and his throat should growl,
                         His hair should twirl and his face should scowl;
                         His eyes should flash and his breast protrude,
                         And this should be his customary attitude—(pose).
          
            CHORUS.—His foot should stamp, etc.
          
            [All dance off excepting RALPH, who remains, leaning pensively
            against
            bulwark.
          
                                    Enter JOSEPHINE from cabin
          
              JOS. It is useless—Sir Joseph's attentions nauseate me. I know
            that he
            is a truly great and good man, for he told me so himself, but to
            me he
            seems tedious, fretful, and dictatorial. Yet his must be a mind
            of no
            common order, or he would not dare to teach my dear father to
            dance a
            hornpipe on the cabin table. (Sees RALPH.) Ralph Rackstraw!
            (Overcome by
            emotion.)
              RALPH. Aye, lady—no other than poor Ralph Rackstraw!
              JOS. (aside). How my heart beats! (Aloud) And why poor, Ralph?
              RALPH. I am poor in the essence of happiness, lady—rich only
            in never-
            ending unrest. In me there meet a combination of antithetical
            elements
            which are at eternal war with one another. Driven hither by
            objective
            influences—thither by subjective emotions—wafted one moment
            into
            blazing day, by mocking hope—plunged the next into the Cimmerian
            darkness of tangible despair, I am but a living ganglion of
            irreconcilable antagonisms. I hope I make myself clear, lady?
              JOS. Perfectly. (Aside.) His simple eloquence goes to my heart.
            Oh, if
            I dared—but no, the thought is madness! (Aloud.) Dismiss these
            foolish
            fancies, they torture you but needlessly. Come, make one effort.
              RALPH (aside). I will—one. (Aloud.) Josephine!
              JOS. (Indignantly). Sir!
              RALPH. Aye, even though Jove's armoury were launched at the
            head of the
            audacious mortal whose lips, unhallowed by relationship, dared to
            breathe
            that precious word, yet would I breathe it once, and then
            perchance be
            silent evermore. Josephine, in one brief breath I will
            concentrate the
            hopes, the doubts, the anxious fears of six weary months.
            Josephine, I am
            a British sailor, and I love you!
              JOS. Sir, this audacity! (Aside.) Oh, my heart, my beating
            heart!
            (Aloud.) This unwarrantable presumption on the part of a common
            sailor!
            (Aside.) Common! oh, the irony of the word! (Crossing, aloud.)
            Oh, sir,
            you forget the disparity in our ranks.
              RALPH. I forget nothing, haughty lady. I love you desperately,
            my life
            is in your hand—I lay it at your feet! Give me hope, and what I
            lack in
            education and polite accomplishments, that I will endeavour to
            acquire.
            Drive me to despair, and in death alone I shall look for
            consolation. I
            am proud and cannot stoop to implore. I have spoken and I wait
            your word.
              JOS. You shall not wait long. Your proffered love I haughtily
            reject.
            Go, sir, and learn to cast your eyes on some village maiden in
            your own
            poor rank—they should be lowered before your captain's daughter.
